# vRealize Automation Blueprint Deployment Library

An opensource and unofficial SDK for publishing and deploying vRealize Automation Blueprints.

# Whats the purpose of this project?

When writing the Jenkins Plugin for vRealize Automation I realized much of my Java classes could be re-used for other projects.
I decided to take what I learned from the Jenkins Plugin and create an opensource java SDK that can be used by other projects.

# Whats the current status?

In the coming weeks I will begin refactoring my code from the Jenkins plugin and commiting the code to this project.  I 
will also refactor the Jenkins plugin to use this SDK and I may create plugins for other platforms that will use this project.
